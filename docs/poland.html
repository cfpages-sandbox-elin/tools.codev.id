    <div class="heading-2">Overall Assessment</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        This manuscript examines an important and timely topic at the intersection of sustainability reporting, corporate governance, and financial reporting quality in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. The study addresses a significant gap in the literature by investigating the paradoxical relationship between ESG disclosure and earnings management in emerging markets, with particular attention to the moderating role of board diversity. The research is well-structured, employs appropriate methodologies, and presents findings that challenge conventional wisdom about ESG's role in constraining opportunistic behavior. While the study makes valuable contributions, there are several areas that could be strengthened to enhance its impact and applicability.
    </div>
    
    <div class="heading-2">Strengths of the Study</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        The manuscript demonstrates several notable strengths:
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>1. Relevance and Timeliness:</strong> The research addresses a contemporary issue of increasing importance to investors, regulators, and firms worldwide. As ESG considerations continue to gain prominence in investment decisions and regulatory frameworks, understanding their relationship with financial reporting quality is crucial.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>2. Regional Focus:</strong> The focus on GCC firms provides valuable insights into a region that has been relatively underexplored in the ESG literature. The unique institutional, cultural, and regulatory environment of the GCC countries offers an interesting context for examining ESG practices and their implications.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>3. Methodological Rigor:</strong> The use of random effect GLS regression and moderation analysis with a substantial sample size (910 firm-year observations) lends credibility to the findings. The measurement of earnings management using the Modified Jones Method, adjusted for heteroscedasticity and model misspecifications, demonstrates methodological sophistication.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>4. Counterintuitive Findings:</strong> The discovery that ESG disclosure is positively associated with earnings management in the GCC context challenges the predominant narrative in Western markets and contributes to a more nuanced understanding of ESG's role in different institutional environments.
    </div>
    
    <div class="heading-2">Methodological Considerations</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        While the methodology is generally sound, several aspects warrant further consideration:
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>1. Endogeneity Concerns:</strong> The authors acknowledge potential endogeneity issues but could more thoroughly address how these might affect their findings. The relationship between ESG disclosure and earnings management could be influenced by unobserved firm characteristics or reverse causality. Future research might consider employing instrumental variables or a two-stage least squares approach to mitigate these concerns.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>2. Measurement of Board Diversity:</strong> The measurement of board diversity appears to be binary (0 or 1), which may oversimplify this multidimensional construct. A more nuanced approach might consider the degree of diversity (e.g., percentage of women directors, percentage of independent directors, diversity indices combining multiple dimensions) rather than a simple presence/absence indicator.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>3. Sample Period:</strong> The study covers the period from 2015 to 2024, which includes significant global events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, oil price fluctuations) that may have differentially affected GCC firms. The authors should discuss how these external shocks might have influenced their findings and consider conducting robustness checks by excluding crisis periods.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>4. Country-Level Differences:</strong> The GCC countries, while often grouped together, have distinct regulatory environments, market structures, and cultural contexts. The analysis could be strengthened by examining whether the relationships hold consistently across all six countries or if there are significant country-specific variations.
    </div>
    
    <div class="heading-2">Theoretical Framework</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        The manuscript draws on stakeholder theory and legitimacy theory to interpret its findings. While these frameworks provide useful lenses, the theoretical development could be enhanced in several ways:
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>1. Integration of Institutional Theory:</strong> Given the focus on emerging markets, institutional theory could provide valuable insights into how formal and informal institutions in the GCC region shape ESG practices and their relationship with financial reporting quality.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>2. Agency Theory Considerations:</strong> While the authors mention agency theory in passing, a more explicit discussion of how agency problems manifest in the GCC context—where ownership structures often differ from Western markets—would strengthen the theoretical foundation.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>3. Cultural Dimensions:</strong> The unique cultural characteristics of GCC countries, including values related to transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement, could be more thoroughly integrated into the theoretical framework to explain the study's findings.
    </div>
    
    <div class="heading-2">Interpretation of Findings</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        The interpretation of the positive relationship between ESG disclosure and earnings management as evidence of "impression management" or "symbolic compliance" is plausible and aligns with legitimacy theory. However, alternative interpretations should be considered:
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>1. Resource Allocation Perspective:</strong> The positive association might reflect resource allocation trade-offs, where firms investing heavily in ESG initiatives may have fewer resources available for robust internal controls and financial reporting systems.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>2. Institutional Development Stage:</strong> The findings might reflect the early stage of ESG development in the GCC region, where firms are still developing the capacity to integrate ESG considerations meaningfully rather than symbolically.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>3. Measurement Issues:</strong> The positive relationship could partly stem from measurement challenges, particularly if ESG scores in emerging markets capture different aspects or are computed differently than in developed markets.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        The finding that board diversity weakens the positive ESG-EM association is particularly interesting and suggests that governance structures play a crucial role in ensuring that ESG commitments translate into genuine reporting discipline. This finding has important implications for regulators and firms in emerging markets.
    </div>
    
    <div class="heading-2">Practical Implications</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        The study offers several valuable practical implications, which could be further developed:
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>1. For Investors:</strong> The findings suggest that investors in GCC markets should be cautious when interpreting ESG disclosures as signals of reporting quality. The authors could provide more specific guidance on how investors might distinguish between substantive and symbolic ESG practices, perhaps by examining board composition or other governance indicators.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>2. For Regulators:</strong> The study highlights the need for regulators in emerging markets to consider governance structures when developing ESG disclosure frameworks. The authors could offer more concrete policy recommendations, such as specific board diversity requirements or complementary governance mechanisms that might enhance the credibility of ESG disclosures.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>3. For Firms:</strong> The findings suggest that firms seeking to enhance the credibility of their ESG disclosures should focus on board diversity as a complementary governance mechanism. The authors could provide more specific guidance on how firms might effectively implement board diversity initiatives in the GCC context, considering cultural and institutional factors.
    </div>
    
    <div class="heading-2">Suggestions for Improvement</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        Based on my experience as both an academic and a consultant in the field, I offer the following suggestions to strengthen the manuscript:
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>1. Additional Robustness Checks:</strong> The authors could conduct additional robustness checks, such as using alternative measures of earnings management (e.g., accruals quality measures, real earnings management proxies) or employing different estimation techniques (e.g., fixed effects models, GMM estimators) to address potential endogeneity concerns.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>2. Qualitative Insights:</strong> The quantitative analysis could be complemented with qualitative insights from interviews with board members, executives, or regulators in the GCC region. This would provide richer context for understanding the motivations behind ESG disclosures and the role of board diversity in shaping these practices.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>3. Extended Analysis of ESG Components:</strong> While the study examines environmental, social, and governance components separately, a more detailed analysis of specific sub-components within each pillar could reveal nuanced patterns and provide more targeted implications.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>4. Industry-Specific Analysis:</strong> The analysis could be extended to examine whether the relationships vary across industries, particularly between high-impact sectors (e.g., oil and gas, manufacturing) and service sectors. This would provide more granular insights relevant to investors and regulators.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>5. Longitudinal Analysis:</strong> A more detailed longitudinal analysis examining how the relationships have evolved over time, particularly in response to regulatory changes or global events, would add depth to the findings.
    </div>
    
    <div class="heading-2">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        This manuscript makes a valuable contribution to the literature on ESG disclosure and financial reporting quality in emerging markets. The findings challenge conventional wisdom and highlight the importance of context in understanding the relationship between sustainability practices and financial reporting behavior. The study's focus on the GCC region addresses an important gap in the literature and provides insights relevant to investors, regulators, and firms operating in similar institutional environments.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        While the manuscript has several strengths, including methodological rigor and relevant findings, it could be enhanced by addressing the methodological and theoretical considerations outlined above. The suggested improvements would strengthen the study's contributions and increase its applicability to both academic and practitioner audiences.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        Overall, this is a well-executed study that addresses an important topic with significant implications for theory and practice. With the suggested revisions, it has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the literature on ESG, corporate governance, and financial reporting quality in emerging markets.

    <div class="heading-1">Additional Comments from a Consultant's Perspective</div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        Drawing from my experience as a consultant for various industries, including oil and gas companies in Indonesia, I would like to offer some additional observations that might further strengthen the manuscript's practical relevance:
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>1. Implementation Challenges:</strong> The study could benefit from a discussion of the practical challenges firms in the GCC region face when implementing both ESG initiatives and board diversity reforms. Drawing on specific examples or case studies would make the findings more tangible for practitioners.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>2. Cost-Benefit Analysis:</strong> The manuscript could explore the cost-benefit trade-offs firms face when deciding between symbolic and substantive ESG practices. This perspective would be particularly valuable for managers and board members grappling with resource allocation decisions.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>3. Change Management Considerations:</strong> The study could address the change management aspects of implementing board diversity reforms and their impact on ESG practices. This would provide practical guidance for firms seeking to enhance the credibility of their ESG disclosures through governance reforms.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>4. Regional Comparison:</strong> A comparison with other emerging markets in Southeast Asia or Africa could provide valuable context and highlight region-specific factors that influence the relationship between ESG disclosure and earnings management. This broader perspective would enhance the study's contribution to the international business literature.
    </div>
    <div class="normal-text">
        <strong>5. Future Trends:</strong> The manuscript could conclude with a discussion of expected future trends in ESG disclosure and board diversity in the GCC region, particularly in light of global sustainability initiatives and increasing investor pressure for transparency. This forward-looking perspective would enhance the study's relevance for both researchers and practitioners.
